# Running the unit tests in IntelliJ

You don't need to install a plugin. IntelliJ IDEA (Community and Ultimate) already includes the
**JUnit** and **Gradle** plugins, and those give you the test runner window with a green/red tree
for each test.

## One-time check

1. **Settings → Plugins → Installed:** check that **JUnit** and **Gradle** are enabled. Both are on
   by default.
2. Open the project as a Gradle project (open the folder containing `build.gradle.kts`). After the
   Gradle sync, `src/test/java` shows up as a green test folder.
3. **Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Run tests using:** leave this
   on **Gradle** (the default). Gradle runs `generateApiEndpoints` before the tests, and the
   `GeneratedApiEndpointsTest` needs that. With "IntelliJ IDEA" selected it only works after one
   normal build.
4. Install `glslangValidator` on PATH (`glslang` on Arch, `glslang-tools` on Ubuntu) for the shader
   tests. Local runs skip shader checks when the compiler is unavailable. Restart IntelliJ if you
   changed its PATH.

## Run tests

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| All tests | Right-click `src/test/java` → **Run 'All Tests'**, or in the **Gradle** tool window run **Tasks → verification → test**. |
| One test class | Click the green ▶ in the gutter next to `class XyzTest`. |
| One test method | Click the green ▶ next to that method. |
| One case of a parameterized test | Run the method, then right-click the case in the results tree → **Run**. |
| Re-run only failures | In the Run window, click **Rerun Failed Tests** (the ▶ with a red ✕). |
| Re-run on every change | In the Run window, toggle **Toggle auto-test** (circular arrow icon). |
| Coverage | ▶ gutter menu → **Run with Coverage**. It shows which lines the tests reach. |

## Reading the results

The **Run** window shows a tree of every test class and method:

- ✔ green: passed. ✖ red: failed. ⚠ yellow: error or ignored.
- Click a failed test to see the assertion message and stack trace on the right. **Click to see
  difference** opens a side-by-side comparison of expected and actual values.
- The two icons at the top of the tree show or hide passed and ignored tests. Hide the passed ones to
  see only what broke.

Outside the IDE, the same results are in `build/reports/tests/test/index.html` after running
`./gradlew test`. Open that file in a browser.

`./gradlew build` runs the Java tests and `MinecraftStartupTest` on every build. Test failures
fail the build; no separate test command or script is required.

For a background build and test run on Linux, use `tools/scripts/test-async.sh`. It returns immediately
and prints the log and result paths. The result file appears when finished: `0` means success.
JUnit targets 16 concurrent test classes, with sequential methods inside each class.

`MinecraftStartupTest` runs concurrently with the other Java tests. It starts a separate client
under `build/client-startup/`, waits one second at the main menu, then closes it. A crash, early
exit or three-minute startup timeout fails the test. Its console and Minecraft logs stay in that
run's directory. The test mod is excluded from the shipped addon JAR.

Run this test through Gradle so Loom prepares its launch command. A graphics display is required;
CI uses `xvfb-run -a ./gradlew test` with Mesa. This checks OpenGL startup, not world or server behavior.

## What's covered

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `TrustedHttpTest` | SSRF guard: private, loopback and metadata addresses blocked; URL scheme and credential rules; logs never contain the API host or URL. |
| `GeneratedApiEndpointsTest` | Every encrypted API URL decrypts to the value in `secrets.properties` (or the example file). |
| `RangeUtilsTest` | Nuker-style reach: distance to the nearest point of the block, edges count. |
| `Vp8LDecoderTest` | WebP decoder: pixel-exact against libwebp for several images and the shipped icons; truncated or corrupted files never crash it. |
| `KitbotChatCommandParserTest` | `$goto`/`$update`/`$kit`/`$send`/`$token`/`$claim` parsing, errors, and tab-completion. |
| `AdaptiveRateTest` | Fractional per-tick rates (1.5 → 1-2-1-2 = 30/s, no float drift) and adaptive-placements step up/down. |
| `GhostBlockProbeTest` | Ghost-block check: packet pairing, verify, ghost and timeout handling. |
| `ShaderCompatibilityTest` | OpenGL/Vulkan compilation and linking for all backgrounds and inline effects; rejects invalid GLSL and stage type mismatches. Skipped locally without `glslangValidator`; required in CI and `checkShaders`. No GPU context. |

Apart from the startup test, tests run without a game. World and server behavior still need
separate client checks.
