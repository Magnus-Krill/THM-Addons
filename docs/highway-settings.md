# Highway Settings Guide

This public guide explains the user-facing settings in `THM-HighwayBuilder` (`HighwayBuilderTHM`), `THM Highway Monitor` (`THMHwyMonitor`), and the Highway Profiles section of the THM Addon tab.

## Highway Profiles

Highway Profiles let you keep separate complete HighwayBuilder configurations for `None`, `HighwayBuilding`, and `HighwayDigging`.

1. Open the **THM Addon** tab.
2. Select a value under **Highway Profiles**.
3. Press **Apply Profile**.

Applying a different profile saves the complete current HighwayBuilder configuration under the profile you are leaving before loading the selected profile. Changes made while using a profile are restored the next time you return to it. Profile snapshots persist with the THM Addon configuration.

For users upgrading from an earlier version, the existing HighwayBuilder configuration becomes the `None` profile baseline. Selecting or applying `None` does not force preset values over those settings.

With status logging enabled, HighwayBuilder reports `pave` for `HighwayBuilding` and `dig` for
`HighwayDigging` on startup, profile changes and the usual five-minute status interval. Kitbot
uses a recent confirmation for the status board and API proof-of-work classification on the same
direction. `None` sends the original status format without a mode field, so Kitbot estimates from
block counts. Proof-of-work validation still applies.

Status and proof-of-work submissions include the addon version. Proof of work also checks the
Axis Viewer network: axes, Nether rings, diamonds, grid roads and extensions keep their normal
rates. Work outside that network receives 20% distance credit. Rendering toggles do not affect
this check, and pausing preserves eligibility from the build position. Older clients keep their
existing rates until the server enables a minimum addon version.

The first time `HighwayBuilding` or `HighwayDigging` is applied, it starts from the current settings and applies these public seed values:

| Profile | Initial public seed values |
| --- | --- |
| `None` | No forced changes; preserves the current HighwayBuilder configuration. |
| `HighwayBuilding` | Width `5`, height `3`, `Replace` floor, railings and mine-above-railings enabled, Obsidian placement, Highway Monitor management when Baritone is installed, plus the proven paving setup: THM speed `4.98`, `blocks-per-tick` `6.96`, `save-pickaxes` `0`, `place-range` `5.4`, `placements-per-tick` `1.0`, `break-speed-multiplier` `1.465`, egap food restock at `14`, ender-chest search on with `11` saved, stats webhook+API on, KitBot restock with `6` ender chests (KitBotThenEnderChest). |
| `HighwayDigging` | Width `5`, height `4`, `Replace` floor, railings and mine-above-railings enabled, Netherrack/Basalt/Blackstone/Soul Soil placement, and Highway Monitor management enabled when Baritone is installed. |

After that first seed, each profile loads its own saved values rather than reapplying defaults. The `toggle-modules` setting defaults to `true`; when enabled, **Apply Profile** also activates HighwayBuilder if it is currently off.

The tabbed HighwayBuilder screen can also save the current settings as a named custom preset. Each preset is stored as `<Name>.json` under `meteor-client/thm/highway-builder-presets`, loaded when HighwayBuilder is registered during Minecraft startup, and applied from the **Custom preset** selector with its **Apply** button. Imported files are size- and depth-limited and may contain only known HighwayBuilder groups and settings.

Restock and KitBot enclosures use Netherrack. With `offhand-build`, it is temporarily moved into the offhand and the previous item is restored afterwards; otherwise it is moved to the hotbar and placed with the normal main-hand swap. Enclosure blocks are placed normally, one at a time, even when Packet Build is enabled.

TPS safety enclosures also use Netherrack. After TPS recovers, the builder removes its enclosure blocks on all four sides before moving forward. Existing nearby blocks are left alone.

With `Manage-hotbar` enabled, HighwayBuilder keeps food in slot 5, trash blocks in slot 6, ender chests in slot 7, a usable pickaxe in slot 8, and configured placement blocks in slot 9. It refills empty supply slots from inventory and pauses sorting during restocks, open containers, and item use. Offhand refills use spare inventory stacks first and leave at least one item in reserved hotbar slots.

`keep-trash-block-stacks` counts hotbar and main-inventory stacks together. A limit of `1` keeps one trash block stack across both. Protected items remain excluded from trash cleanup.

Carried shulkers are checked before external restock sources. Exhausting loose ender chests does not hide ender chests still inside shulkers; `search-shulkers` and `mine-ender-chests` must be enabled to use them for obsidian.

Restock cleanup keeps the held tool when another tool has the same mining score. Offhand and packet-build loadouts let the restock state control the main hand while containers are being removed.

Offhand restocks keep their supplies through recovery instead of refilling with obsidian. Chest,
totem and tool swaps work with a full inventory, including `minimum-empty-slots` set to `0`. EChest mining keeps the configured reserve outside the offhand so predictive replacement cannot consume it. If there is no room to separate an existing offhand stack, normal placement respects the reserve and predictive replacement waits.

Single EChest restocks use the same standing height as the enclosure and clear solid blocks above the lid before opening.

## Quick Cheat Sheet

### Pause And Continue

Press **Pause builder** in the HighwayBuilder control screen to save the current statistics,
position and working direction. The builder turns off and releases movement controls so you can
move freely. **Continue builder** uses Baritone to return to the saved position, restores the
working direction and pitch, then resumes the same statistics session. The module keybind also
continues a paused builder. **Cancel return** stops Baritone and keeps the builder paused.
**Stop builder** finishes the paused statistics session without returning; distance ends at
the pause position. Speed and Timer are temporarily disabled during the return and restored afterwards.

Continue requires the same server/world and dimension. Failed paths, timeouts and disconnects
leave the builder paused for another attempt. Statistics use the existing disk checkpoint;
the return position lasts until the client closes. The classic settings screen also has a
**Pause / Continue builder** button.

Movement jumps and world/dimension changes no longer invalidate statistics. Saved invalidation
flags are ignored, and older sessions without continuity metadata can submit again. Coordinates
must still be finite. Adventure-mode backup/lobby visits preserve the last main-server position;
distance uses that checkpoint until Survival resumes.

Container restocking accepts replaceable blocks at the shulker/EChest position. If a solid block
obstructs it, recovery keeps mining that block before tearing down the enclosure and retrying
the restock. Unbreakable blocks or a 30-second clearing timeout stop with the block and position.

### Reconnect Lobby Portals

During an armed Highway Monitor or Elytra Route reconnect, Adventure mode in the Overworld
identifies the main lobby. Adventure mode in the End identifies the backup/transfer server,
except while a trusted cracked-login prompt identifies the authentication flow.

On lobby entry, reconnect chooses the nearest portal from the loaded chunks using the entry
position, then uses Baritone to walk into its bottom row. It waits for chunks if no portal is
loaded and retries interrupted paths. A path-complete message does not finish the lobby stage;
only a server-state change advances reconnect. Manual joins do not start portal walking.

| `protected-items` | Ender chest, obsidian, netherite tools, elytra, totem, egaps, XP bottles | Items trash cleanup must never throw out. |
| `food-restock` | `false` | Restocks one configured food stack when food reaches the saved amount. |
| `food-management` | `None`; options `None`, `Auto Eat`, `Auto Gap` | Keeps the selected Meteor food module enabled while building. |
| `food-types` | Empty list; shown when food restock or food management is active | Food items counted for restock/food management. Multiple allowed — selection order is priority, top item preferred (its max stack size is used for restock math). Its own picker has Up/Down buttons to reorder. |
| `save-food` | `16`, range `1-32`; shown when `food-restock` is on | Food count threshold that queues restock. |
| `minimum-empty-slots` | `1`, minimum `0`, slider `0-9` | Empty inventory slots to preserve after mining obsidian. |

### Ender Chests

| Setting | Default / Range | What to change it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mine-ender-chests` | `true` | Mines ender chests to convert them into obsidian. |
| `save-ender-chests` | `4`, range `4-64` | Loose ender chest reserve to keep in inventory. |
| `break-mode` | `Instant rebreak on place`; shown when `mine-ender-chests` and `offhand-build` are on | How a placed chest is broken again: `Speedmine rebreak`, `Instant rebreak`, `Instant rebreak on place` or `Normal breaking`. |
| `break-mode-no-offhand` | `Speedmine rebreak`; shown when `mine-ender-chests` is on and `offhand-build` is off | Same choice without the on-place mode, which needs the chest in the offhand. |
| `rebreak-delay` | `0`, slider max `20`; shown for `Instant rebreak` | Ticks between rebreak packets. |
| `silent-rebreak-swap` | `true`; shown unless the mode is `Normal breaking` | Restores your selected slot after a rebreak or chest placement. |
| `predictive-echest-replace` | `true`; shown for offhand OnPlace rebreak | Places the next offhand EChest immediately after the rebreak packet. |
| `use-break-speed-multiplier` | `true`; shown when `mine-ender-chests` is on | Temporarily boosts Timer while mining ender chests. |
| `break-speed-multiplier` | `1.5`, range `1-3`; shown when the boost is on | How much Timer is boosted. |

### KitBot Updates

| Setting | Default / Options | What to change it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kitbot-update-on-finish` | `true` | Sends `$update` to KitBot1 with the current direction when the module finishes, then disconnects. |
| `kitbot-periodic-update` | `true` | Sends periodic `$update` requests while building, deferred during restock. |
| `kitbot-update-interval-minutes` | `30`, range `30-60` | Minutes between automatic updates (minimum 30 so KitBot1 is not flooded). Changing it restarts the countdown unless an update is pending. The countdown uses real time and survives relogs; it only starts fresh after the builder was inactive for more than 10 minutes. |

### Highway Monitor Recovery

**ChunkRefresh** pauses HighwayBuilder, Timer, and Speed, then walks one chunk backward. It reports a view distance of 2 while checking for a server unload of the stalled chunk. If that chunk remains tracked, it extends the retreat beyond the server's reported radius plus its tracking margin, with a minimum of four chunks. Travel timeouts scale with distance. Once the server confirms an unload, it stops retreating, restores the latest reported options, and returns to the first backstep. It resumes only after receiving fresh chunk data and finding that chunk loaded. Baritone cannot break or place during this recovery; its settings are restored afterward. Failures stop Baritone, restore the distance, and leave HighwayBuilder paused without an automatic disconnect. This mode also works with auto-reconnect off.

Vanilla 26.2 clamps the client request to a server-side minimum of 2 and retains a tracking margin. An unchanged options packet or a local chunk deletion cannot force a resend. A server that ignores the lower distance requires a longer retreat beyond its reported radius. The recovery still requires server unload and replacement packets. Diagonal backsteps move one chunk along each travel axis. F3+A+S alone refreshes outer chunks and cannot guarantee nearby chunks are reloaded.

| Setting | Default / Range | What to change it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto-recover` | `true` | Enables automatic monitor corrections while HighwayBuilder is active. |
| `true-center-mode` | `true` | Uses 0.5-centered highway math. |
| `check-interval` | `2`, range `1-20` | How often alignment is checked. |
| `max-correction-distance` | `10.0`, range `0.5-32.0` | Largest automatic horizontal correction allowed. |
| `repair-misalignments` | `false` | Steps back 2 blocks first so the builder can repair possible bad paving/digging. |
| `recover-forward-stalls` | `true`; shown when `auto-recover` is on | Escapes Forward/Center stalls with a forced backstep. |
| `recover-rubberband-ghostblocks` | `true`; shown when `auto-recover` is on | Enables recovery for long rubberband or ghostblock stalls. |
| `rubberband-recovery-mode` | `Reconnect`; options `Reconnect`, `ChunkRefresh` | Reconnect reloads the world; ChunkRefresh retreats and reloads affected chunks without leaving the server. |

| `Anti-drop` | `false` | Always | Prevents dropping items the module considers needed. |
| `offhand-build` | `true` | Always | Mines with the pickaxe in hand and places your block from the offhand. AutoTotem is paused and Meteor Offhand cannot swap the slot while building; the builder puts a totem there at low health or with an enemy near. While ender chests are being mined the offhand holds the chests instead, so a chest can be placed and mined in the same tick without swapping; the offhand returns to your placement block afterwards. |
| `Anti-hunger` | `true` | Always | Turns Meteor's AntiHunger on while building and off again when it stops. If you already had it on, it is left alone. |
| `minimum-empty-slots` | `1`, minimum `0`, slider `0-9` | Always | Empty inventory slots to preserve after obsidian mining. |

### THM-HighwayBuilder: Ender Chests

| Setting | Default / Range / Options | Visible when | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mine-ender-chests` | `true` | Always | Mines ender chests to create obsidian. |
| `save-ender-chests` | `4`, range `4-64` | Always | Loose ender chests to reserve; falling one below this queues restock, and failure to replenish can hard-fail the module. |
| `break-mode` | `Instant rebreak on place`; options below | `mine-ender-chests` and `offhand-build` are on | Picks one breaking method for the mining cycle. **Speedmine rebreak**: breaks with THM Speedmine, turning its `auto-rebreak` on for the cycle and putting your own setting back afterwards. **Instant rebreak**: after placing a chest, sends a sequenced `STOP_DESTROY_BLOCK` plus a swing (the same shape Meteor's InstantRebreak uses); the server breaks it at once when its stored mining progress for that spot is far enough along, otherwise it records the attempt and finishes the block itself a few ticks later. **Instant rebreak on place**: sends the same packet immediately after a successful normal placement, then retries it while the chest remains visible instead of falling back to a normal break on the next tick. With `offhand-build`, the pickaxe stays in the main hand. **Normal breaking**: plain mining, no packet tricks. |
| `break-mode-no-offhand` | `Speedmine rebreak` | `mine-ender-chests` is on, `offhand-build` is off | Same modes as `break-mode` minus **Instant rebreak on place**, which needs the chest in the offhand. It's a separate setting because a select can't hide a single option. |
| `rebreak-delay` | `0`, slider max `20` | Mode is `Instant rebreak` | Delay in ticks between rebreak packets. |
| `silent-rebreak-swap` | `true` | Mode is not `Normal breaking` | Restores your previously selected slot after a rebreak packet or a chest placement. |
| `predictive-echest-replace` | `true` | Offhand OnPlace mode | Places the next offhand EChest immediately after the rebreak packet. |
| `use-break-speed-multiplier` | `true` | `mine-ender-chests` is on | Temporarily boosts Timer while mining ender chests, then restores the previous Timer state. |
| `break-speed-multiplier` | `1.5`, range `1-3` | `mine-ender-chests` and `use-break-speed-multiplier` are on | Timer multiplier used during ender chest mining. |

### THM-HighwayBuilder: KitBot Updates

| Setting | Default / Range / Options | Visible when | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kitbot-update-on-finish` | `true` | Always | Sends `$update` to KitBot1 with the current highway direction when the module finishes, waits for KitBot to teleport, then disconnects. |
| `kitbot-periodic-update` | `true` | Always | Sends periodic `$update` requests to KitBot1 while building; delayed until restock completes. |
| `kitbot-update-interval-minutes` | `30`, range `30-60` | `kitbot-periodic-update` is on | Minutes between automatic updates; real-time countdown that survives relogs. |

### THM-HighwayBuilder: Experimental

| Setting | Default / Range | Shown when | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enable-experimental` | `false` | Always | Master switch for this group: every setting below is ignored (and hidden) while it is off. |
| `predictive-echest-rebreak` | `false` | Experimental enabled, offhand OnPlace mode | Sends three rebreak STOP packets per tick. |
| `packet-budget` | `false` | `enable-experimental` is on | Caps mine and place actions each tick so their packet cost stays under `packets-per-tick`. Mining is served first; Packet Build gives unused mining capacity to lookahead placement. One mine action always goes through so the builder cannot stall. Counts start+stop per mined block, one use-on-block per placed block, movement, slot swaps, and swing packets unless PaketLimiter filters them. |
| `packets-per-tick` | `23`, range `4-200` | `packet-budget` is on | The tick's packet allowance. Set it below the server's own limit. |

### THM-HighwayBuilder: Debugging

`Toggle block rate debug` starts or stops a local chat update every second in both control screens. `block-rate-mode` selects BPS or average blocks per client tick; both show the actual BPS against the 30 BPS benchmark. Rates cover one real second, exclude restock and enclosure work, and read zero while the builder is off. Packet placement attempts count only after the block appears, once per position. The Highway HUD shows `Dug` and `Paved` in BPS; use `show-dig-rate` and `show-place-rate` to hide either line.

| Setting | Default / Range / Options | Visible when | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `debug` | `false` | Always | Writes state transitions and movement input to `logs/thm/<start-time>/highwaybuilder-debug.log`. |
| `block-rate-debug` | `false` | Always | Prints Dug/Paved rates to local chat every second. |
| `block-rate-mode` | `BPS`; `BPS`, `BlocksPerTick` | Always | Selects the chat rate units. |
| `forward-scheduler-debug` | `false` | `legacy-mode` is off | Logs active row, queue, boundary, and actionability details for the forward scheduler. |
| `statistics-debug` | `false` | Always | Logs detailed stats validation decisions for mine/place work. |
| `restock-debug-log` | `false` | Always | Writes blockade/restock diagnostics to `logs/thm/<start-time>/highwaybuilder-restock-debug.log` and EChest place/rebreak timing to `logs/thm/<start-time>/highwaybuilder-echest-debug.log`. |
| `session-summary` | `false` | Always | When the builder turns off, prints duration, distance, blocks placed (with average/s), broken, restocks, e-chest refills, rubberbands, adaptive drops and ghost blocks. |

### THM-HighwayBuilder: Render

| Setting | Default / Range / Options | Visible when | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `render-reach` | `false` | Always | Outlines every non-air block within `place-range` through walls (white), with scheduler work in blue (ahead) and orange (behind). |
| `render-blocks-to-mine` | `true` | Always | Renders blocks selected for mining. |
| `blocks-to-mine-shape-mode` | `Both`; Meteor `ShapeMode` | Always | Controls whether mine targets render sides, lines, or both. |
| `blocks-to-mine-side-color` | RGBA `225,25,25,25` | Always | Fill color for mine target rendering. |
| `blocks-to-mine-line-color` | RGBA `225,25,25,255` | Always | Outline color for mine target rendering. |
| `render-blocks-to-place` | `true` | Always | Renders blocks selected for placement. |
| `blocks-to-place-shape-mode` | `Both`; Meteor `ShapeMode` | Always | Controls whether place targets render sides, lines, or both. |
| `blocks-to-place-side-color` | RGBA `25,25,225,25` | Always | Fill color for place target rendering. |
| `blocks-to-place-line-color` | RGBA `25,25,225,255` | Always | Outline color for place target rendering. |

### THM-HighwayBuilder: Logging

| Setting | Default / Range / Options | Visible when | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `print-statistics` | `true` | Always | Prints HighwayBuilder statistics in chat when the module disables. |
| `auto-screenshot-statistics` | `false` | `print-statistics` is on | Captures chat or disconnect statistics after rendering. |
| `Send-Status` | `true` | Always | Sends a status update every 5 minutes with digging/paving, axis, name, and API token. |
| `sends-statistics(Webhook)` | `false` | `print-statistics` is on | Sends HighwayBuilder statistics to a webhook when the module disables. |
| `webhook` | `MyWebhookInHere` | `print-statistics` and `sends-statistics(Webhook)` are on | Webhook URL used for statistics delivery. |
| `sends-statistics(API)` | `false` | `print-statistics` is on | Sends statistics to the API when the module disables. |

Proof screenshots wait for two completed visible frames. Disconnect captures wait up to 30 seconds
for the matching reason and statistics screen, with loading overlays cleared. Chat captures wait
up to five seconds for visible chat. A timeout releases the chat buffer and cancels the capture.

Every THM debug category also writes to `logs/thm/<start-time>/thm-debug-all.log`, with its source filename on each line. The start-time folder uses local `yyyy-MM-dd_HH.mm.ss` and is created when the first log line is written. Existing logs stay in `logs/thm/`. Logs rotate at 100 MB.
