# THM Addons Features

This document lists the modules, HUD widgets, and utilities shipped with THM Addons. Module names match the in-game Meteor module list.

## Highway and Travel
- `THM-HighwayBuilder` — Automatically builds highways according to THM standards.
- `THM Highway Monitor` — Monitors alignment and recovers HighwayBuilder from drift, with reconnect or chunk-refresh recovery. Requires Baritone.
- `Highway-Tools` — Highway utilities: axis walker, highway teleporter, boundary finder, and highway checker. Requires Baritone.
- `axis-viewer` — Displays world axes and Nether highways, including XaeroPlus rings, diamonds, the 50k grid, and 125k extensions.
- `scaffold-THM` — Scaffolds blocks under you.
- `auto-portal` — For the Base Hunter who has places to be.
- `Fly-Bypass` — Fly using packets.
- `no-fall`: Meteor NoFall with NoGround mode, mace support, and optional reset packets on disable.
- `highway-traveler` — Travels along anarchy highways (walk, wasp, bounce or Elytra Fly with Elytra Route's obstacle pathing); can stop at the end of the paved or dug highway.
- `elytra-route` — Flies to a target bearing, restocks from inventory shulkers, and manages periodic home saves. When no way through the air exists, it lands and continues on foot with Baritone. Requires Baritone.

## Mining and Building
- `better-baritone-build` — Index opened storage, fetch missing build materials with Baritone, and manage block replacement/acceptance rules, dirt/grass equivalence, and log stripping in a custom screen.
- `tunnel-miner` — Mines a tunnel block-by-block to target XZ coordinates at the same Y.
- `Speedmine`: Packet mining with early packet rebreaks and client-world fallback, Off/Strict/Strong/Bypass modes, a rebreak-rate monitor, tool swap timing, TPS sync, client prediction, and optional multitasking while using items. Auto Mine can independently continue bedrock mining while eating with `bedrock-while-eating` (off by default). Optional `debug-auto-mine` reports targets and idle reasons in chat. Strong retries completed targets without an air confirmation. Active and automatic mining continue with the inventory open. Optional Air Miner removes the airborne speed penalty and claims ground around mining actions, with a speed cap and opt-in gliding.
- `BlockCounter` — Counts the selected blocks.
- `Better-echest-farmer` — Better echest farmer that uses instant rebreak exploit.
- `sign-render` — Renders sign text through walls with advanced clustering.
- `nuker` — Nuker with many additions.

- `THM Stash mover` — Keeps named kit-pair deposit storage topped off with full shulker kits.

## UI

- The THM tab shows the cracked-account password only for offline UUIDs; hiding it preserves its saved value.
- Custom THM categories: `THM Highway` and `THM PVP`.
- Disconnect button on the vanilla "Loading terrain" screen, which otherwise has no way out when it hangs.
- GUI themes: `Dark`, `Snowy`, `Lambda`, `Stardust`, `Midnight`, `Monochrome`, `Nether`.
